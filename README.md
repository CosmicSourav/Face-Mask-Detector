# Face-Mask-Detector
Tensorflow, Keras, and OpenCV are three Python libraries used to develop and build the model presented here. The convolutional neural network model we utilised was MobileNetV2. Transfer Learning is the way of employing MobileNetV2. Transfer learning is the process of utilising a previously trained model to train your current model and obtain a prediction, which saves time and simplifies the process of training various models. The hyperparameters: number of epochs, learning rate, and batch size are used to fine-tune the model. The model is trained on a set of photos divided into two categories: with and without a mask. There are 1915 photos with masks and 1918 images without masks in the collection.
• The dataset was utilized to prepare the model.
• Putting the model into action.
